# library-sys

If you are reading this then you have successfully cloned the repository. 

Here are the instructions on how to make the library-sys work.

1.) Create a new database in your MYSQL Management tool (i.e. phpmyadmin, SQLyog). Name it as "lib_sys".
2.) After you have cloned the repository, Use Git Bash inside the library-sys folder.
3.) Open up the .env file with a text editor. The .env file is found inside the library-sys folder.
4.) Change the Database Password under the DB_PASSWORD Label. The Database Password is the Password that you use for database connections. 
5.) You can also change the HOST name, Port, and Username depending on what you are using in your MYSQL Management tool.
6.) After you have set your database connection for the env. Now you can migrate the database. Enter "php artisan migrate" in the command line.
7.) After it prompts that the migration was successful, Enter "php artisan serve" in the command line.
8.) The terminal automatically uses port 8000. Open up any browser and type in "localhost:8000".
9.) You are now all set!
